## Meh


The frontend for this Twitter replica is built with React and Redux in TypeScript. The files are mostly organized based on their purpose. 

The Services folder mostly contains helper functions that are called by the frontend to access data from the server.

Pages are large components that are at the root level and the Components folder contains building blocks of components. 

I tried to use Redux to make the stage management more clear and robust.
